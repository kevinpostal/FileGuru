# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current download progress system only shows basic status updates (downloading, processing, completed) without granular progress information. Users experience a long period with no feedback during the actual download phase, creating uncertainty about whether the system is working. This feature will enhance the progress reporting to provide real-time download progress updates and better user experience through continuous feedback.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user downloading a video, I want to see real-time progress updates during the download, so that I know the system is actively working and can estimate completion time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a download starts THEN the system SHALL capture and report download progress from yt-dlp
2. WHEN yt-dlp outputs progress information THEN the system SHALL parse percentage, speed, and ETA data
3. WHEN progress data is available THEN the system SHALL send progress updates to the client via WebSocket at least every 2 seconds
4. WHEN progress reaches 100% THEN the system SHALL transition to "processing" status for upload phase

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a visual progress bar that moves smoothly, so that I feel confident the download is progressing even during slower periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN no real progress data is available THEN the system SHALL provide simulated progress updates
2. WHEN simulated progress is used THEN the system SHALL increment progress by small amounts every 1-2 seconds
3. WHEN real progress data becomes available THEN the system SHALL smoothly transition from simulated to real progress
4. WHEN progress updates are sent THEN they SHALL include percentage, download speed, and estimated time remaining

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see additional download information like file size and download speed, so that I can better understand the download process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN progress updates are sent THEN they SHALL include current download speed in human-readable format
2. WHEN file size information is available THEN progress updates SHALL include total file size
3. WHEN ETA information is available THEN progress updates SHALL include estimated time remaining
4. IF download speed drops below threshold THEN the system SHALL continue showing progress to avoid appearing stuck

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the progress system to be robust and handle edge cases, so that users always receive meaningful feedback regardless of yt-dlp behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN yt-dlp doesn't provide progress information THEN the system SHALL fall back to simulated progress
2. WHEN yt-dlp progress parsing fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with fallback progress
3. WHEN WebSocket connection is lost THEN the system SHALL continue processing and update client when reconnected
4. WHEN download takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL adjust progress simulation to avoid reaching 100% prematurely
5. WHEN multiple progress formats are encountered THEN the system SHALL handle different yt-dlp output formats gracefully
