# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Enhance progress parsing infrastructure

  - Improve regex patterns in `parse_progress_line()` method to handle multiple yt-dlp output formats
  - Add validation and sanitization for extracted progress data
  - Implement comprehensive logging for debugging progress parsing issues
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 4.2_

- [x] 2. Create progress state management system

  - Implement `ProgressState` class to track download progress state per client
  - Add methods for managing real vs simulated progress coordination
  - Create progress history tracking for validation and smoothing
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.4_

- [x] 3. Implement fallback progress generator


  - Create `FallbackProgressGenerator` class with realistic progress simulation
  - Implement multi-phase progress simulation (initialization, downloading, finalizing)
  - Add adaptive timing based on download patterns and estimated duration
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] 4. Enhance WebSocket progress updates





  - Modify `send_throttled_progress_update()` to include rich metadata (speed, ETA, file size)
  - Implement adaptive throttling based on progress rate and connection quality
  - Add progress type indicators (real, simulated, hybrid) to update payload
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 5. Integrate enhanced progress system into download workflow





  - Modify `download_file()` method to use new progress state management
  - Implement seamless transitions between real and simulated progress
  - Add fallback activation when no real progress is detected within timeout
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 4.1, 4.4_

- [x] 6. Improve error handling and recovery





  - Add robust error handling for progress parsing failures
  - Implement graceful degradation when WebSocket updates fail
  - Add stall detection and recovery mechanisms for stuck downloads
  - _Requirements: 4.2, 4.3, 3.4_

- [x] 7. Enhance frontend progress display





  - Update JavaScript progress handling to process enhanced progress data
  - Add display for download speed, ETA, and file size information
  - Implement smooth progress bar transitions and better visual feedback
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 8. Enhanced initialization progress simulation
  - Implemented immediate fallback activation during initialization phase
  - Added rapid initial progress burst for first 3 seconds of download
  - Created engaging progress messages that change based on progress level
  - Enhanced metadata extraction with progress updates
  - Reduced fallback timeout to 2 seconds for faster response
  - Added progress updates during subprocess startup
  - _Requirements: User experience improvement for initialization delays_

- [ ] 9. Add comprehensive testing
  - Create unit tests for progress parsing with various yt-dlp output formats
  - Add integration tests for complete progress flow from worker to frontend
  - Implement tests for fallback scenarios and error recovery
  - _Requirements: 4.5_

- [ ] 10. Performance optimization and monitoring
  - Optimize progress update frequency to balance responsiveness and performance
  - Add metrics collection for progress update success rates and timing
  - Fine-tune simulation algorithms based on real-world usage patterns
  - _Requirements: 4.4, 4.5_
