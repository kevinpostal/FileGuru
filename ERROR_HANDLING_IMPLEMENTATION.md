# Enhanced Error Handling and Recovery Implementation

## Overview

Task 6 from the enhanced download progress specification has been successfully implemented, adding robust error handling and recovery mechanisms to the yt-dlp worker system.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Robust Progress Parsing Error Handling

**Methods Added:**
- `_handle_progress_parsing_failure()` - Handles parsing failures with recovery mechanisms
- `_reset_parsing_failure_count()` - Resets failure count on successful parse

**Features:**
- Tracks consecutive parsing failures per client
- Automatically activates fallback progress after 3 consecutive failures
- Detailed error logging for debugging
- Maintains progress continuity even when parsing fails
- Automatic recovery when parsing succeeds again

### 2. WebSocket Graceful Degradation

**Methods Added:**
- `_send_progress_request()` - Enhanced WebSocket sending with retry logic
- `_reset_websocket_failure_tracking()` - Resets failure tracking on success
- `_handle_websocket_failure()` - Implements graceful degradation strategies
- `_is_websocket_degraded()` - Checks if client is in degraded mode

**Features:**
- **Retry Mechanism**: Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Temporarily stops attempts after 5 consecutive failures
- **Degraded Mode**: Reduces update frequency after 3 failures to avoid overwhelming failing connections
- **Connection Quality Assessment**: Adapts behavior based on failure rates and response times
- **Timeout Management**: Dynamic timeouts based on connection quality

### 3. Download Stall Detection and Recovery

**Methods Added:**
- `_detect_download_stall()` - Detects when downloads appear stalled
- `_handle_download_stall()` - Implements recovery mechanisms for stalled downloads
- `_reset_stall_detection()` - Cleans up stall detection tracking

**Features:**
- **Multi-Phase Detection**: Different stall thresholds for initialization, download, and finalization phases
- **Recovery Strategies**: 
  - First attempt: Graceful process termination (SIGTERM)
  - Second attempt: Force kill process (SIGKILL)
  - Fallback activation to maintain user feedback
- **Adaptive Thresholds**: Longer timeouts for initialization and finalization phases
- **Progress Continuity**: Maintains progress updates during recovery attempts

### 4. Comprehensive Error Statistics and Monitoring

**Methods Added:**
- `log_error_handling_statistics()` - Logs detailed error handling statistics

**Features:**
- Tracks parsing failure counts per client
- Monitors WebSocket failure rates and degraded mode status
- Records stall detection warnings and recovery attempts
- Provides both per-client and global statistics
- Integrates with existing progress statistics logging

### 5. Enhanced Cleanup and Resource Management

**Enhanced Methods:**
- `cleanup_progress_state()` - Now includes comprehensive error tracking cleanup

**Features:**
- Cleans up all error tracking data structures
- Removes progress caches and connection quality data
- Ensures no memory leaks from error tracking
- Called automatically on download completion or failure

## Integration Points

### Progress Parsing Integration
- Enhanced `parse_progress_line()` with failure handling
- Automatic failure count reset on successful parsing
- Seamless fallback activation when parsing consistently fails

### WebSocket Integration  
- Enhanced `send_throttled_progress_update()` with degraded mode awareness
- Adaptive throttling based on connection quality and failure history
- Circuit breaker integration to prevent overwhelming failed connections

### Download Monitoring Integration
- Stall detection integrated into main download monitoring loop
- Real-time stall detection during download process
- Automatic recovery attempts without user intervention

## Error Handling Flow

```
Progress Parsing Error → Track Failure → After 3 Failures → Activate Fallback
                                     ↓
WebSocket Send Error → Track Failure → After 3 Failures → Degraded Mode
                                    → After 5 Failures → Circuit Breaker
                                     ↓
Download Stall Detected → First Recovery (SIGTERM) → Second Recovery (SIGKILL)
                                                  → Fallback Activation
```

## Testing and Verification

The implementation has been verified through:
- Static code analysis for method presence and integration
- Feature verification for all key error handling capabilities
- Import verification for required dependencies
- Integration point verification for seamless operation

## Benefits

1. **Improved Reliability**: Downloads continue to provide feedback even when components fail
2. **Better User Experience**: Smooth progress updates maintained during error conditions
3. **Resource Efficiency**: Circuit breaker prevents wasting resources on failed connections
